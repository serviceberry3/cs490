Ants eat the bait and return to the colony. (4). Bait is shared with the queen and others, killing the entire colony. Ants crawl in to eat. 2. Crawl away to die. Directions for Household Use: It is a violation of federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling. For thorough ant control, use all baits at one time, To keep ants from returning, replace all baits every three months. (1) Separate baits before placement. (2) For thorough ant control, all four baits must be used at one time. For larger kitchens or particularly heavy infestations, we strongly recommend using additional baits.(3) For best results, place the baits next to the wall along baseboards, in corners, under sinks, in cabinets and near plumbing fixtures. You can even place baits in cabinets. Do not contaminate feed or food products or food preparation surfaces, dishes, kitchen utensils and food containers. (4) Baits work best on horizontal surfaces touching corners and walls. (5) Ants will begin eating the bait immediately and you should expect to see fewer ants within days. (6) Replace all baits every three months to keep ants from returning.  Storage and Disposal: Storage: Store in a cool, dry area inaccessible to children. Do not store above 130 degrees F.
