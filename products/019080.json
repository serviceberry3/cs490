Using a standard 8 oz measuring cup. These amounts are averages and your cat's needs may differ. So feeding should be adjusted as necessary to maintain an ideal body condition. Want some variety? Serve it up by feeding your cat Purina Friskies canned in addition to or mixed with Purina Friskies dry. Remember, cats are nibblers who enjoy eating small meals throughout the day, so your cat would appreciate it if you keep a bowl of Purina Friskies dry cat food available at all times. Curious About Other Friskies Flavors? Remember, changes in your cat's diet should be made gradually to allow your cat to become accustomed to a new food. Substitute small amounts of the new food for the old food, gradually increasing the amount of the new food while decreasing the old food, over a period of 7 - 10 days. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets-something both you and your cat can appreciate. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly.  Store in a cool, dry place.","countryOfOrigin":"Crafted In Purina-owned Facilities In The USA.,Crafted In Purina-owned Facilities In The USA.
