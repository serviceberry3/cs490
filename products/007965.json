Remove solids daily. Add more litter to maintain a depth of 2-3 inches. Use a moisture-proof cat box large enough to comfortably accommodate your cat(s). We recommend removing solid waste daily and cleaning the cat box with warm water and a mild detergent between litter changes.  Store in a dry place.  To Open: Pull colored tape off to the left.","warnings":"Note: We want to remind those with suppressed immune systems and pregnant women that a parasite sometimes found in cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis. Please wash hands thoroughly after handling used cat litter. Encouraging your cat to use an indoor litter box, or properly disposing of outdoor cat feces, is beneficial to overall water quality. Please do not flush cat litter in toilets or dispose of it outdoors in gutters or storm drains. Used litter is not recommended for garden use.","countryOfOrigin":"Made In USA.,Made In USA.
