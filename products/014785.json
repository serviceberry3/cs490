Weight of Cat: 10-14 lbs (4.5-6.3 kg); Feeding Amount: 2/3 - 1 cup (63 - 94 g). Recommended daily feeding amounts for adult cats with normal activity using a standard 8 oz / 250 ml measuring cup which contains approximately 94 g of Purina One. Adult Cat Feeding Instructions: Fill your cat's bowl with the recommended measured amount every morning and allow your cat to eat on a free choice basis throughout the day, rather than as a single feeding at mealtime. Food intake required to maintain an ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Monitor your cat's weight and adjust food amount accordingly. Feed Only One: A cat's digestive system works best when it receives the same food each day. Although humans crave variety in their diets, cats do not. Feeding different cat foods can turn your cat into a finicky eater, and may lead to obesity. For questions related to the health of your cat, see your veterinarian. It's Not for All Cats: Purina One Tender Selects Blend with Real Chicken no.1 ingredient is specifically formulated for adult cats. If you have a kitten, or a pregnant or nursing cat, feed Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula. Making the Switch to Purina One: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Purina One can make in your cat, please allow 7-10 days to ease the transition from your cat's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Purina One until you're feeding Purina One exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. No Supplements Necessary: Purina One provides 100% complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult cats. There is no need to add vitamins, minerals or other supplements, unless specifically directed by a veterinarian. Fresh Water, Proper Diet & Veterinary Care: Be sure to provide fresh water in a clean container for your cat daily. Proper diet, exercise and veterinary care are the best ways to keep your cat healthy. If your cat hasn't had a check-up in the past year, please make an appointment today.","countryOfOrigin":"Crafted In Purina-owned Facilities In The USA.,Crafted In Purina-owned Facilities In The USA.
