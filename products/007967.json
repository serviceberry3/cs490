Introducing the Original Kitty Litter: In 1947, a man was asked if he could help a friend find sand for her cat's litter box. Little did he know, by not having what she needed, he would discover one of the greatest inventions in cat history, ever - clay litter. That litter soon took on the name Tidy Cats. And, even today, the reliable, non-clumping litter found in this very bag is based on that same, simple product (with a few enhancements - we are Tidy Cats, after all). Tidy Cats Has You Covered. We know it's our job to follow every road that leads to freshness. That's why we never stop searching for a better litter box experience. For over 50 years, we've fought odor, cut down on dust and helped simplify litter box maintenance. And in doing so, a complete line of litter care products was born. So there's always a clever solution that's right for you and the other noses in your home. Product is filled by weight; some settling may occur. Purina - Your Pet, Our Passion.
