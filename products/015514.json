Recommended Daily Feeding Amounts: Weight of Cat: 5-9 lbs (2.3-4.1 kg); Feeding Amounts: 1/3 to 3/4 cup (35-75 g); Weight of Cat: 10-14 lbs (4.5-6.3 kg); Feeding Amounts: 3/4 to 1-1/6 cups (75-120 g). Recommended daily feeding amounts for adult cats with normal activity using a standard 8 oz/250 ml measuring cup which contains approximately 100 g of Purina One. Adult Cat Feeding Instructions: Fill your cat's bowl with the recommended measured amount every morning and allow your cat to eat on a free-choice basis throughout the day, rather than as just a single feeding at mealtime. Food intake required to maintain ideal body condition will vary, depending on age, activity and environment. Monitor your cat's weight, and adjust food amount accordingly. Do Not Mix with Other Cat Foods: Purina One Urinary Tract Health Formula is designed to be fed exclusively and should not be mixed with any other type of cat food. That's because Purina One Urinary Tract Health Formula is carefully balanced to reduce urinary pH and provide low dietary magnesium. By mixing in other products or switching to other brands, Purina One Urinary Tract Health Formula may no longer be effective in reducing urinary pH, which is essential in maintaining urinary tract health. It's Not for All Cats: Purina One Urinary Tract Health Formula is specifically formulated for adult cats. If you have a kitten, or a pregnant or nursing cat, feed Purina One Healthy Kitten Formula. It's specifically formulated for their unique nutritional needs. If your veterinarian has your cat on a specific diet, see him/her before making any changes. Making the Switch to Purina One: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Purina One can make in your cat, please allow 7-10 days to ease the transition from your cat's current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Purina One until you're feeding Purina One exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. No Supplements Necessary: Purina One Urinary Tract Health Formula provides 100% complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of the adult cat. There is no need to add vitamins, minerals or other supplements, unless specifically directed by a veterinarian. Fresh Water, Proper Diet & Veterinary Care: Be sure to provide fresh water in a clean container for your cat daily. Proper diet, exercise and veterinary care are the best ways to keep your cat healthy. If your cat hasn't had a check-up in the past year, please make an appointment today. Helps Maintain Urinary Tract Health: A cat's urinary tract health is a big concern for many cat owners. And research shows that a diet of Purina One Urinary Tract Health Formula can help certain adult cats maintain a health urinary tract. How? With a diet that reduces urine pH and provides low dietary magnesium.","countryOfOrigin":"Crafted In Purina-owned Facilities In The USA.,Crafted In Purina-owned Facilities In The USA.
