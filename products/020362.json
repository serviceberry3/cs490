Age: 7 weeks - 6 months; Total Daily Amount: 1/3 to 3/4 cup; Frequency: 3 - 4 times a day. Age: 7 months - 1 year; Total Daily Amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup; Frequency: 2 times a day. Using a standard 8 oz measuring cup. Feeding Kittens: Kittens generally nibble solid foods at 3 - 4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Purina Kitten Chow Nurture available to these kittens at all times. Just add one part liquid to three parts Purina Kitten Chow Nurture, changing frequently to ensure freshness. After weaning, at 6 - 8 weeks of age, kittens will normally eat dry or moistened food at will. Start a self-feeding program, leaving food in dish at all times. Feeding amounts should be adjusted as necessary to help your kitten maintain an ideal body condition. Because kittens continue to develop throughout their first year, it‰Ûªs important that they get the extra nutrition of Purina Kitten Chow Nurture for a full 12 months. After one year of age, transition to the Purina Cat Chow formula that‰Ûªs right for your cat. Feeding for Reproduction: Purina Kitten Chow Nurture provides the extra nutrition needed by reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. Food consumption may vary during gestation, so feed the amount needed to maintain the pregnant female‰Ûªs good body condition. Food intake may double or even quadruple during lactation. Feeding Tip: Changes in your cat‰Ûªs diet should be made gradually to allow your cat to become accustomed to a new food. Substitute small amounts of the new food for the old food, gradually increasing the amount of the new food while decreasing the old food, over a period of 7 - 10 days. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean bowl daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly.  Store in a cool, dry place.","countryOfOrigin":"Crafted In USA Facilities.,Printed In USA.
