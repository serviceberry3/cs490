Adult Dog Feeding Instructions: The recommended feeding amounts indicated are based upon the average nutritional needs of an adult dog with a normal activity level (using a standard 8 oz/250 ml measuring cup, which contains approximately 95 g of Purina One). Factors, such as a dog‰Ûªs metabolism, breed size, activity level, age and whether the dog is spayed or neutered, will affect the amount of Purina One needed to maintain an ideal body condition. The pet experts at Purina have provided the feeding amounts indicated as a starting point. If you find that your dog is losing weight or becomes overweight when fed these amounts, please adjust accordingly. To help your dog maintain an ideal body condition, monitor your dog's weight on a regular basis, making sure that his ribs are easily felt and his waist is visible when viewed from above. Maintaining an ideal body condition can impact your dog's lifelong health. Making the Switch to Purina One: Although you'll be anxious to see the difference Purina One can make in your dog, please allow 7-10 days to ease the transition from his current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Purina One until you‰Ûªre feeding Purina One exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upset. No Supplements Necessary: Purina One provides 100% complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance of adult dogs. There is no need to add vitamins, minerals or other supplements, unless specifically directed by a veterinarian. Fresh Water, Proper Diet a Veterinary Care: Be sure to provide fresh water in a clean container for your dog daily. Proper diet, exercise and veterinary care are the best ways to keep your dog healthy. If your dog hasn't had a check-up in the past year, please make appointment today.","countryOfOrigin":"Crafted In USA Facilities. Crafted In Purina-owned Facilities In The USA.,Printed In USA.
