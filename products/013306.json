Easy pour spout.  Since 1925.  ECO friendly.  The taste of a memory.  Sodium free.  Fat free. In 1925 Aron Streit opened his first matzo bakery. That was on Rivington Street in Manhattan's Lower East Side, a place that would become as famous for its food as for its Yiddish theater.  A tasty kugel, a hearty soup, a delicious matzo ball. People who lived there shared more than dreams of a better life in America - they shared their family's treasured recipes.  Streit's was there then and we're here now.  We work out of the very same building used by our great-grandfather and we share his vision: to bring you wholesome Jewish food that takes you back to your childhood and connects you with your past.  Streit's. The taste of a memory.  The Laws of Challah have been fulfilled.  Excellence in kosher baking for over 80 years.  Under the supervision of Rabbi M. Soloviechik.
