Pour to a depth of 2-3 inches. 2. Remove solids daily. 3. Add more litter to maintain a depth of 2-3 inches. Use a moisture-proof cat box large enough to comfortably accommodate your cat(s). We recommend removing solid waste daily and cleaning the cat box with warm water and a mild detergent between litter changes.","warnings":"Note: We want to remind those with suppressed immune systems and pregnant women that a parasite sometimes found in cat feces can cause toxoplasmosis. Please wash hand thoroughly after handling used cat litter. Encouraging your cat to use an indoor litter box, or properly disposing of outdoor cat feces, is beneficial to overall water quality. Please do not flush cat litter in toilets or dispose of it outdoors in gutter or storm drains. Used litter is not recommended for garden use. Store in a dry place. Product is filled by weight; some settling may occur.","countryOfOrigin":"Made In USA.
