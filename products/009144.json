Cowboy comfort food. Oi hired hand. I started selling my vittles back in 48 in San Angelo, Texas, as close to the heart of chili country as any human wants to get. Way back, people believed chili could rid warts, grow hair, and generally increase stamina. But I guess knowin' chili just comes down to what Will Rogers said: A bowl of chili is a bowl of blessedness. I think you'll agree with will agree you try my chili. Oi Hired Hand. These chili mixin's contain ground masa flour, ground chili pepper, yellow corn meal, salt, cumin, cayenne pepper, garlic powder and real oregano.

One Bowl of this savory potion grabs all the flavor and richness of the Old West. Easy Directions: (1) Add the 2 large brown pouches of Mixin's to 1 cup of water in a bowl - set aside. (2) Brown 2 lbs. hamburger - drain the grease. (3) Add 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes (juice and all) to meat. (4) Stir Mixin's and water mixture into the meat and tomatoes. If wanted, add drained can of pinto or kidney beans. Bring to a boil. (5) Now add the small red pepper pouch for heat levels like these: Tenderfoot Chili (Family Style) wave the Unopened pouch over the chili - don't add any - but tell 'em you did. Outlaw Chili (Medium Hot) - stir in 1/2 the pepper. Hot enough to drive in-laws out. Six Gun Chili (Hot) - add all the pepper-then stir fast if you want to keep the spoon! (6) Simmer uncovered for 30 mins. or longer adding water as desired for a thick stew consistency. As an option, the large white pouch of masa flour can be used to thicken the chili. Mix it with warm water to a batter thickness and add to the simmering chili. You've just made the best chili that ever met a mouth!","countryOfOrigin":"USA","manufacturerName":"Far West Trail Cooks Assn","pareve":false,"active":true,"kosherImages":[]},"bmsm":false,"bmsmTiers":[],"guidingStars":0,"availableDisplayCoupons":[],"options":[],"suppressSwapAndSave":true,"productCategoryId":581,"aisle":"4","pickStoreLocationId":"04B-005-015-016","saleMeta":{"pricePoint":3.99},"hasPriceAdjustment":true,"hasPickStoreLocation":true,"hasCoupon":false,"pickupLockerAvailable":true,"sustainabilityRating":-1,"categoryPath":[311,305,243,166,1],"subCategoryId":[581,567,505,385,1],"groups":["995853","1395830","1356946","1356948","1711328","1356949","1356953","prism_ams_1735918","1190855","1530592","1522555","1356960","1579665","1540503","1356951","1356952","1687251","527895","prism_ams_1","248583","1232725","1491461","1642327"],"active":true,"isMarketplaceProduct":false,"ebtEligible":true,"variableWeight":false,"bottleDepositMap":{},"isAlcohol":false,"categories":[]}],"pagination":{"rows":0,"start":0,"total":0}}}
