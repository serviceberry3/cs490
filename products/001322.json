Transition to the Purina Dog Chow Formula that's right for your dog after 2 years. Amounts are recommended for an average puppy with normal activity. Remember food intake requirements vary depending on age, activity and environment, and should be adjusted accordingly. Feeding Weaning Pups: Puppies start to nibble on solid foods at 3-4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Purina Puppy Chow (Three parts kibble to one part water) available to puppies at all times until fully weaned (6-8 weeks of age). Feeding Grown Pups: After weaning, Purina Puppy Chow can be fed moistened or dry at the same time every day - very young puppies three times a day, older puppies twice a day. Use the feeding guidelines shown here, but remember individual needs can vary. Feed to maintain ideal body condition as shown. Slight appetite changes and occasional digestive upsets are normal in puppies. If upsets become severe or linger longer than a day or two, contact your veterinarian. Feeding for Reproduction: Purina Puppy Chow provides the extra nutrition needed by reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. Food consumption may vary during gestation, so feed the amount needed to maintain the pregnant female's good body condition. Food intake may double or even quadruple during lactation. Switching to Purina Puppy Chow: When switching to Purina Puppy chow from another food, please allow 7-10 days for the transition. Gradually add more Purina Puppy Chow and less of the previous food to your pet's dish each day until the changeover is complete. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly. Ideal Body Condition Chart: The Purina Life Plan: An unprecedented fourteen-year study by Purina proves that you can help extend your dog's healthy years by feeding to his deal body condition throughout his life. Use recommended feeding amounts as shown. Too Thin: Ribs are highly visible. Increase the amount you are feeding for 2-3 weeks and then re-evaluate. Ideal: You can feel the outline of the ribs. Puppies at a healthy weight have an hourglass figure. Too Heavy: Puppy has no waist and rounded belly. Decrease the amount you are feeding for 2-3 weeks and then re-evaluate.","countryOfOrigin":"Crafted In USA Facilities.,Crafted In USA Facilities.
