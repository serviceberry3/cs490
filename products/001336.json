These amounts are averages and your cat's needs may differ. Feeding amounts should be adjusted as necessary to help your cat maintain an ideal body condition. Feeding Kittens: Kittens generally nibble solid foods at 3 - 4 weeks of age. Keep moistened Purina Cat Chow Complete available to these kittens at all times. Just add one part liquid to three parts Purina Cat Chow Complete, changing frequently to ensure freshness. After weaning, at 6 - 8 weeks of age. Kittens will normally eat dry to moistened food at will. Start a self-feeding program, leaving food in the dish at all times. Feeding amounts should be adjusted as necessary to help your kitten maintain an ideal body condition. Feeding For Reproduction: Purina Cat Chow Complete provides the extra nutrition needed by reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. Food consumption may vary during gestation, so feed the amount needed to maintain the pregnant female‰Ûªs good body condition. Food intake may double or even quadruple during lactation. Feeding Tip: Changes in your pet's diet should be made gradually to allow your cat to become accustomed to a new food. Substitute small amounts of the new food for the old food, gradually increasing the amount of the new food while decreasing the old food, over a period of 7 - 10 days. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. Provide adequate fresh water in a clean container daily. For your pet's health, see your veterinarian regularly.  Store in a cool, dry place.","warnings":"Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that Purina Cat Chow Complete provides complete and balanced nutrition for all life stages of cats.","countryOfOrigin":"Crafted In Purina Owned Facilities In The USA.
