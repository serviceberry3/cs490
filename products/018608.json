FireWise: Burns Cleaner than Wood: Duraflame firelogs light faster and burn more completely than firewood, and because far less material is consumed when burning a firelog, significantly fewer pollutants are emitted than a comparable wood fire. 80% less fine particles (Source: Dec 2005 Environment Canada/US EPA Reg. 5 'Content and emission characteristics of artificial wax firelogs'). 75% less carbon monoxide (Source: Dec 2005 Environment Canada/US EPA Reg. 5 'Content and emission characteristics of artificial wax firelogs'). 90% less hazardous air pollutants (Source: Dec 2005 Environment Canada/US EPA Reg. 5 'Content and emission characteristics of artificial wax firelogs'). Saves Trees: A duraflame firelog consumes 80% less material than a comparable 4 hour wood fire, and burning firelogs instead of wood results in significantly fewer trees cut down for use as firewood. Recycled & Renewable: Duraflame firelogs use recycled and renewable wood sawdust and agricultural fibers, saving valuable natural resources. The renewable fibers are mixed with blends of wax and other combustible, renewable materials.","directions":"Read instructions before use. Duraflame firelogs may be burned in all types of indoor, open-hearth fireplaces. They are designed to light fast and burn up to 4 hours when used according to instructions. Variations in fireplace and climatic conditions may alter duration of burn. Heat content is approximately 78,000 BTU. IF used in an outdoor fireplace / fire pit, use only in a well-ventilated area, and not under any form of cover. Weather conditions and wind may cause the log to produce more smoke and burn for a shorter duration. Lighting Instructions: 1: Carefully pull outward on the seam of the wrapper (without tearing) to loosen it from the log and create an air space. 2: Place firelog (only one) on supporting grate with arrows pointing down and seam facing room. 3: Light the seam below each arrow. Close fireplace screen.","warnings":"California Proposition 65 Warning: Warning: Burning this manufactured firelog results in emissions that can expose you to chemicals including carbon monoxide, soot, smoke and other combustion by-products, which are known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm, and/or other adverse health effects. For more information go to www.P65Warnigns.ca.gov.Caution - Risk of Fire: The Duraflame firelog is designed to light easily with a match or butane utility lighter. Do not use flammable liquids, fire starters, or fireplace gas log lighters to ignite firelog. Do not poke a burning firelog with fireplace tools unless the fire is almost out. Poking or breaking up a burning firelog in the first 3 hours after lighting can cause the firelog to become extremely flammable and result in sudden flare-up. Flaming particles may stick to tools. Do not place wood or any other items on burning firelog. To extinguish firelog in an emergency, use UL listed dry chemical fire extinguisher or carefully douse fire with water. Do not close fireplace damper until ashes are cool. Dispose of cool ashes in garbage. Not suitable for use in gardens. Do not use in airtight wood stoves or inserts or in barbecue grills. Do not use for roasting marshmallows or other cooking.Air Quality Advisory: Use of this and other solid fuels may be restricted at times by law. Please check 1-877-4NO-BURN or http://www.8774noburn.org before burning. Safety Instructions: Instructions: For a safe and long-burning fire, follow instructions carefully. Open fireplace damper before lighting firelog. Burn firelog on supporting grate toward the back of fireplace. Grates with bar spacing greater than three inches do not provide adequate support and may result on firelog breakage, flare-up, and/or reduced burn time. Do not burn firelogs on andirons. Burn only one firelog at a time, and never add anything to an existing firelog fire. Do not burn firelog with any other materials. Close wire mesh protective fire screen when burning firelog. Always leave fireplace glass doors open while firelog is burning unless fireplace manufacturer's instructions indicate otherwise. Never leave any fire unattended. Do not allow children or pets to play near fire. Always make sure the log is completely extinguished (no flame or smoke) before leaving the house or going to bed. Logs that are not completely extinguished can produce smoke after the flames go out. Carefully break up the firelog with a fireplace poker at the very end of the burn when a small flame is still present. This should allow any remaining log material to burn out. Store out of reach from children and pets. Not suitable for human or animal consumption.","countryOfOrigin":"Made In USA.,USA","manufacturerName":"Duraflame, Inc.","pareve":false,"active":true,"kosherImages":[]},"bmsm":false,"bmsmTiers":[],"guidingStars":0,"availableDisplayCoupons":[],"options":[],"suppressSwapAndSave":true,"productCategoryId":1635,"aisle":"14","pickStoreLocationId":"14A-004-003-003","hasPriceAdjustment":false,"hasPickStoreLocation":true,"hasCoupon":false,"pickupLockerAvailable":true,"sustainabilityRating":-1,"categoryPath":[1733,1675,1],"subCategoryId":[1635,1580,1],"groups":["1395830","873635","1356955","1530592","1639852","1522555","1263589","1579665","1540503","870334","1687251","prism_ams_1","1232725","1491461","959627","1642327"],"active":true,"isMarketplaceProduct":false,"ebtEligible":false,"variableWeight":false,"bottleDepositMap":{},"isAlcohol":false,"categories":[]}],"pagination":{"rows":0,"start":0,"total":0}}}
